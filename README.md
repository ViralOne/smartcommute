# ðŸšŒ Bus LiveMap

Bus LiveMap is a web application that displays the real-time location of Bus buses on a map. The app uses Leaflet to display the map and fetches the bus location data from the Bus API. The app allows the user to follow a specific bus on the map and displays the routes of all available buses.

# Installation

No installation is required to use the Tursib LiveMap application. Simply fork the repo and open the `index.html` in browser.

# Usage

- Visit the webpage in your web browser.
- Select a bus route from the list of available routes.
- Optionally, click the "Follow the Bus" checkbox to center the map view on the selected bus.
- The map will display the real-time location of the selected bus.

# To do ðŸ”¨
- [x] Update design for Mobile
- [x] Update design for Desktop
- [x] Add stops on the map
- [x] Add 'Get my location'
- [x] [Update map marker icon](https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/)
- [x] Draw map route for each Bus

# Bugs ðŸ˜”
- [ ] The logic for obtaining and displaying the stop markers is too simplistic and does not account for all possible scenarios and right now some stops are missing or shown wrong
